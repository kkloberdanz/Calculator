# Calculator

Description:

    An interactive, command line based calculator

    Supports user defined constants

TODO:

    * Needs to support user defined functions

    * Maybe make it Turing complete?
      - Could be done through recursive functions

    * Add trigonometry and integration functionality

Bugs:

    * All values are stored as doubles.
      - This is stupid and needs to change
